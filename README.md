Viksit Health

AI‑Based Smart Hospital Flow & Resource Management System

📌 About the Project
Viksit Health is an AI‑powered healthcare platform designed to make hospital visits faster, clearer, and more efficient.
It connects patients, doctors, and hospitals on one smart system using real‑time data and artificial intelligence.

The aim is to reduce:

Long waiting times
Confusion about availability
Doctor overload
Poor use of beds and resources

And replace it with:

Transparency
Planning
Prediction
Better patient experience

⚠️ Important Note
🚧 This is currently a DEMO / PROTOTYPE version.
It is built to show the idea, flow, and feasibility of the system.

If this project is selected or supported further, we plan to:

Improve accuracy of AI models
Add more real‑world features
Strengthen security and performance
Make it production‑ready

🎯 Problem We Are Solving

Hospitals today face:

Long and uncertain waiting times
Poor doctor scheduling
Inefficient bed usage
No prediction of crowd or peak hours

Patients waste time and money, doctors face burnout, and hospitals react only after problems happen.
There is a strong need for a smart, predictive, and transparent healthcare system.

💡 Our Solution

Viksit Health provides one platform for:

👤 Patients
Enter symptoms

Book appointments easily

👨‍⚕️ Doctors
View daily patient list
See patient history
Get AI‑generated summaries
Balanced scheduling

🏥 Hospital / Admin
Bed management
Doctor scheduling
Patient flow monitoring
AI‑based demand prediction
Disease and medicine trend analysis

🤖 Use of AI / ML
AI is used to:

Predict patient waiting time
Map symptoms to departments
Forecast bed demand
Balance doctor workload
Summarize patient history

AI supports decision‑making. Final medical decisions are always made by doctors.

🛠️ Technology Stack

🏁 Conclusion
Viksit Health is a step towards a healthcare system that is:

Predictable instead of chaotic
Transparent instead of confusing
Planned instead of reactive

This version is a demo prototype, but with support and selection, it can be developed into a real‑world, scalable healthcare solution that truly improves lives.

## Running the code

### Development

1. Install dependencies: `npm i` then `npm i --prefix server`
2. Set up the database: `npm run db:push` then `npm run db:seed`
3. Start dev servers: `npm run dev`  
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000  
   - API: http://localhost:4000  

### Production

1. In `server/`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (e.g. SQLite `file:./prod.db` or PostgreSQL connection string)
   - `PORT` (default 4000)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `CORS_ORIGIN` (optional; comma-separated allowed origins)
2. From the project root run:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This builds the frontend, builds the server, then runs the server. The app is served on the port you set (e.g. http://localhost:4000). The same server serves the API under `/api` and the React app for all other routes.
