Viksit Health

AI‑Based Smart Hospital Flow & Resource Management System

📌 About the Project
Viksit Health is an AI‑powered healthcare platform designed to make hospital visits faster, clearer, and more efficient.
It connects patients, doctors, and hospitals on one smart system using real‑time data and artificial intelligence.

The aim is to reduce:

Long waiting times
Confusion about availability
Doctor overload
Poor use of beds and resources

And replace it with:

Transparency
Planning
Prediction
Better patient experience

⚠️ Important Note
🚧 This is currently a DEMO / PROTOTYPE version.
It is built to show the idea, flow, and feasibility of the system.

If this project is selected or supported further, we plan to:

Improve accuracy of AI models
Add more real‑world features
Strengthen security and performance
Make it production‑ready

🎯 Problem We Are Solving

Hospitals today face:

Long and uncertain waiting times
Poor doctor scheduling
Inefficient bed usage
No prediction of crowd or peak hours

Patients waste time and money, doctors face burnout, and hospitals react only after problems happen.
There is a strong need for a smart, predictive, and transparent healthcare system.
